Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I, a Tech Solo-Wanapreneur with a liking for ramen and unconventional sleeping arrangements, showcase my journey through the tech landscape. I thrive on continuous learning and find immense joy in sharing my knowledge with others. Formerly the Head of Machine Learning, I've been navigating the realms of Data Science and Machine Learning since before it was considered cool.
